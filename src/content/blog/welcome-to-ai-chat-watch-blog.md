Welcome to the AI Chat Watch blog. Here we'll cover how to track AI-driven traffic and improve your visibility across AI chatbots without compromising user privacy.

## Why AI traffic matters

AI chatbots like [ChatGPT](/ai-chat-bot/chatgpt/), [Claude](/ai-chat-bot/claude/), [Perplexity](/ai-chat-bot/perplexity/), and [Gemini](/ai-chat-bot/google-gemini/) are becoming primary discovery channels. When users ask these assistants for recommendations, getting cited can send real traffic to your site.

The problem: traditional analytics can't tell you which visitors came from AI chatbot recommendations.

## What is AI Chat Watch?

AI Chat Watch is a web analytics platform that tracks AI referrals. It shows you visitors from ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, and other AI sources. You can see which pages get AI-driven visits and measure whether AI visibility actually leads to conversions.

## Privacy-first design

Unlike traditional analytics, AI Chat Watch doesn't use cookies or tracking pixels. No IP addresses are stored, all data is anonymized, and it's GDPR and CCPA compliant. You get the traffic insights without the surveillance baggage.
