## What are AI search engines

AI search engines give you direct answers instead of a list of links. They use large language models to parse your question and respond in natural language.

Perplexity AI, ChatGPT Search, and Google AI Overview take different approaches. Perplexity focuses on citing sources and research. ChatGPT Search leans into conversational responses. Google AI Overview combines traditional search results with AI-generated summaries.

The appeal is straightforward: instead of clicking through multiple websites, you get your answer immediately. Developers use them for quick documentation lookups. Marketers use them for research. The features vary by platform: Perplexity provides inline citations, ChatGPT offers follow-up conversations, and Google AI Overview appears directly in search results.

## Why AI search engines exist

Traditional search engines index websites and rank them by relevance, but you still have to click through links to find what you need.

AI search engines process your question and generate a direct answer. OpenAI created ChatGPT Search to extend their chatbot. Google developed AI Overview to keep users on their platform. Perplexity was built from scratch as an AI-first search engine.

## How these AI search engines work

Perplexity searches the web for relevant sources when you ask a question, then synthesizes those sources into an answer. Every response includes citations.

ChatGPT Search uses GPT-4 with real-time web access. It responds conversationally but doesn't provide consistent source citations.

Google AI Overview appears at the top of regular Google searches. It uses Gemini models combined with Google's search index to generate summaries.

## Features and capabilities

Perplexity lets you choose between different AI models (GPT-4, Claude), upload files, and search specific sources like academic papers. Citations appear inline for fact-checking.

ChatGPT Search integrates with the main ChatGPT interface. With ChatGPT Plus, you can refine your question without starting over.

Google AI Overview appears in regular searches. Summaries are concise and include links for more details.

## Accuracy and source citations

Accuracy varies between platforms. Perplexity tends to be reliable for factual queries because you can check the citations. ChatGPT Search lacks consistent citation formatting. Google AI Overview benefits from high-quality sources but may oversimplify complex topics.

## Speed and response quality

Perplexity delivers responses in a few seconds, though answers can be wordy for simple questions. ChatGPT Search responds quickly, with quality depending on the question. Google AI Overview appears almost instantly but prioritizes brevity.

## Pricing

Perplexity has a free tier; Pro costs $20/month for advanced models. ChatGPT Search requires ChatGPT Plus at $20/month. Google AI Overview is free.

## Best use cases

Perplexity works well for research where you need to verify sources. ChatGPT Search is better for conversational queries and brainstorming. Google AI Overview is good for quick factual lookups when you don't want to leave search results.
