## What is the SISTRIX Crawler

The SISTRIX Crawler is a specialized web crawler, developed by [SISTRIX GmbH](https://www.sistrix.com/), a German SEO software company. This German SEO tool systematically scans websites across European markets to collect data for SEO analysis. The SISTRIX Crawler and similar SEO bots exist to gather information about websites and their performance in search engines. 

### TL;DR
- **Purpose**: Collects data to support SEO analysis in European markets.
- **Focus**: Primarily targets German-language websites.
- **Metric Power**: Supports the trusted SISTRIX Visibility Index.

The crawler focuses particularly on German-language websites and search results, powering the SISTRIX Visibility Index, [one of the most trusted metrics in European SEO](https://www.sistrix.com/google/visibilityindex). By collecting data about website structures, content changes, technical SEO elements, and ranking positions, it helps marketers and SEO experts make informed decisions for their improvement strategies.

## Why SISTRIX Crawler Exists and Its Purpose

SISTRIX created this crawler to support its flagship product, the SISTRIX Toolbox. Traditional SEO tools often focused on English-language markets and Google.com results, but there was a gap in German search engine optimization and other European markets. 

### Key Objectives:
- Collect reliable, consistent ranking data across European Google domains.
- Monitor millions of keywords daily to track ranking trends.
- Feed data into the SISTRIX Visibility Index, [a measure of overall search visibility](https://www.sistrix.com/visibility-index/explanation-background-and-calculation/).

By collecting ranking data across multiple European domains like google.de and google.fr, the SISTRIX Crawler plays a crucial role in the SEO monitoring process, feeding essential data into the SISTRIX Visibility Index. This makes it a benchmark in German-speaking countries for measuring SEO success.

## How the SISTRIX Crawler Operates

The SISTRIX Crawler identifies itself through specific user-agent strings, making it noticeable in server logs for administrators. The primary user-agent is "SISTRIX Crawler," accompanied by version details and a link to sistrix.com/bot.

### Operational Details:
- **Location**: Operates from IP addresses registered in Bonn, Germany.
- **Technology**: Focuses on server-rendered HTML content without executing JavaScript by default.
- **Ethical Crawling**: Respects robots.txt files and standard web crawling protocols.

By operating efficiently, the SISTRIX Crawler is well-regarded for respecting webmaster guidelines. Websites blocking the crawler won't appear in SISTRIX's visibility calculations, allowing some businesses to protect their SEO data from competitors.

## SISTRIX Visibility Index and Data Collection

The SISTRIX Visibility Index is a core metric derived from the data collected by the crawler. It measures how visible a website is in Google search results across tracked keywords. Here’s how:

- **Tracking**: Millions of keywords in multiple European countries are tracked weekly.
- **Weighted System**: Keywords with higher search volumes contribute more to the score.
- **Data Collection**: Constant collection keeps the index current, aiding in SEO visibility tracking.

## Blocking or Allowing the SISTRIX Crawler

Website owners have full control over the SISTRIX Crawler's access by using robots.txt files. To block it, simply add specific rules:

- **Block Entire Site**: Add "User-agent: SISTRIX" followed by "Disallow: /".
- **Selective Blocking**: Allow access to some areas while blocking others.

Most websites choose to allow the SISTRIX Crawler as it doesn’t cause technical issues or excessive server load.
