## Introduction

Reka AI is a company revolutionizing enterprise AI with advanced multimodal AI models like [Reka Core](https://www.reka.ai/ourmodels). These models process text, images, video, and audio simultaneously, unlike traditional systems that handle only one type of input at a time. This comprehensive capability is crucial for businesses dealing with diverse data formats—imagine analyzing a video presentation complete with slides and speech, as highlighted in [Reka's Vision Platform](https://www.reka.ai/products). Reka Core competes with top models like GPT-4V and [Gemini](https://time.com/6343450/gemini-google-deepmind-ai/), offering enterprises tools to automate complex tasks involving multiple content types. From processing customer service videos to analyzing product demonstrations, Reka models find ideas in mixed media, driving efficient business solutions.

## What is Reka AI


Multimodal AI Processing Overview:

Founded in 2023, Reka AI creates cutting-edge multimodal AI models like Reka Core, a Gemini alternative. The company's name, deriving from a Maori word meaning "to spread" or "to open up," reflects its mission. Reka Core models can handle combinations of text documents, images, video clips, and audio files, understanding how these pieces relate to each other. Whether it's a product demo video or a PDF with charts and images, Reka models maintain context across all input types. Businesses can access these models via APIs and direct enterprise deployments, integrating them seamlessly into existing workflows.

## Why Multimodal AI Exists

Real-world information comes in mixed formats: business documents with charts, customer feedback with videos, and product catalogs mixing images with text. Traditional AI models struggle to process such diversity efficiently, requiring separate systems for text, images, and video that often result in gaps and errors. Multimodal AI, like the models from Reka AI, solves this by learning how text describes images, how video frames connect, and how audio correlates with visual content. This unified understanding is invaluable for companies, saving time and catching details single-mode systems miss—for example, understanding the context behind a smile in a video.

## How Businesses Use Reka AI

Enterprises leverage Reka AI for tasks involving multi-format content analysis. Customer support teams process support tickets with screenshots, videos, and text descriptions, extracting issues faster than human agents. Marketing departments analyze video campaigns by pairing ads with performance data, identifying which visuals correlate with better results. Legal teams process complex contracts, while education companies use Reka to evaluate video lessons, matching visual aids with spoken content. Even in healthcare, Reka's models analyze medical imaging alongside patient notes, spotting inconsistencies often missed by humans. This comprehensive functionality accelerates fraud detection, quality issues, and generates concise video summaries for media companies.

## Reka Core Model Family


Enterprise Use Case Flow:

Reka's Core family includes three primary models: the flagship Reka Core, the speed-focused Reka Flash, and Reka Edge for on-device privacy-sensitive applications. All handle text, images, video, and audio inputs, processing content in over 30 languages. Reka Core supports extended contexts in long documents and processes video clips several minutes long, excelling on enterprise benchmarks by prioritizing accuracy and reducing hallucinations. Users access these models through a usage-based pricing structure via API calls or fixed enterprise licensing.

## Comparison with Leading AI Models

Reka Core distinguishes itself with comprehensive video and audio support in a single model. While GPT-4V excels in text, images, and video, Reka emphasizes enterprise deployment options that many models like Gemini Pro may not always provide. Qwen-VL, primarily a research model, lacks the necessary enterprise infrastructure that Reka AI delivers for business-focused applications.

## Data Privacy and Enterprise Features

Catering to enterprises with strict data requirements, Reka AI offers private cloud deployments where customer data remains secure. Unlike standard API services, these deployments prevent data exposure to third parties, crucial for industries like healthcare and finance. Reka provides compliance with frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA, offering audit logs and contractual guarantees, ensuring data privacy and security.

## Technical Capabilities and Limitations

Reka models excel in understanding relationships across varied content types, offering seamless cross-modal reasoning. However, processing long videos still takes time, and highly specialized domains may require fine-tuning for best results. Though powerful, these models can sometimes misinterpret ambiguous content, a common challenge within AI systems.
