This feature leverages large language models akin to ChatGPT, focusing on writing tasks. Grammarly AI is accessible as a browser extension, desktop app, or mobile keyboard, and users can also edit directly on the Grammarly website.

## Why Grammarly Exists and Its Purpose

Writing tools like Grammarly AI were developed because everyone makes writing mistakes. Even professional writers can miss typos, grammar errors, and awkward phrasing. Companies must ensure their communications appear professional, whether in customer emails, marketing materials, or internal documents. A single grammar mistake in a business proposal can damage credibility. Grammarly AI's purpose extends beyond error detection; it aims to improve writers over time by explaining errors and offering solutions. Each suggestion includes an explanation, teaching users grammar rules as they write. This is particularly beneficial for non-native English speakers, allowing them to write confidently, knowing the AI will catch language mistakes. The plagiarism detection feature serves to ensure content originality. Students use it to confirm their academic work doesn't unintentionally match existing sources, while content creators use it to verify the uniqueness of their articles before publication.

## How Businesses and Users Use Grammarly

Businesses deploy Grammarly across teams to maintain consistent writing quality. Marketing teams refine blog posts, email campaigns, and social media content before publishing. Customer support teams ensure responses are clear and professional, while sales teams use it for proposals and client communications. The Grammarly Business tier allows administrators to create custom style guides for brand voice consistency across all team writing. For instance, a company can set preferences for American vs. British English, formality levels, and specific terminology to use or avoid. Individuals generally use the free version or subscribe to Grammarly Premium for personal writing needs. Web developers use Grammarly AI for writing documentation and README files. SEO experts utilize it to enhance content readability, which impacts search rankings. The tool integrates with content management systems and email clients, eliminating the need for manual copy-pasting.

## Grammarly Pricing Tiers: Free vs Premium vs Business

Grammarly offers three main pricing tiers with distinct features, including a Free version, Pro at $12 per member [per month billed annually, and Enterprise plans for larger organizations](https://www.grammarly.com/business/pricing). The Free version includes basic grammar and spelling checks, tone detection, and limited suggestions but lacks advanced style recommendations and complex grammar explanations. Grammarly Premium, costing around $12 per month annually or $30 per month for monthly billing (prices as of 2024; verify rates on Grammarly's site), adds full-sentence rewrites, vocabulary suggestions, plagiarism detection scanning against 16+ billion web pages, tone adjustments, word choice improvements, and formality level controls. The plagiarism detection tool is exclusive to Premium and Business tiers. The Business tier starts at $15 per user per month annually (prices as of 2024; confirm rates on Grammarly's site) and includes everything in Premium plus centralized billing, priority email support, style guides for brand consistency, an analytics dashboard, and SAML single sign-on for enterprise security. Educational institutions can access special rates through Grammarly for Education. There's also a one-week free trial of Premium, allowing users to test advanced features without commitment, and users can cancel anytime.

## Plagiarism Detection Features

Grammarly AI's plagiarism detection feature scans your text against over 16 billion web pages and academic databases to identify passages matching existing published content. Upon running a plagiarism check, Grammarly displays matching text and original sources, providing an overall originality score as a percentage. Content marketers use this tool before publishing articles to prevent accidental copying from research sources. Students employ it to ensure their papers are properly paraphrased and cited. The plagiarism checker isn't flawless, as it only scans content Grammarly has indexed, excluding some internet content. Paywalled academic journals and certain subscription sites aren't wholly covered. The feature is effective for catching obvious copying but not sophisticated plagiarism. SEO experts value this tool because duplicate content can damage search rankings. Running a plagiarism check pre-publication helps identify potential issues.

## Comparison With Alternative Writing Tools

Several competitors offer similar writing assistance features with varying strengths and pricing models. Here's how Grammarly AI compares:

| Tool                 | Monthly Price     | Plagiarism Check         | Generative AI    | Browser Extension | Key Difference                           |
|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Grammarly Premium    | $30 ($12 annual)  | Yes                      | Yes (GrammarlyGO)| Yes               | Most complete features, largest user base |
| ProWritingAid        | $30 ($10 annual)  | Yes (extra fee)          | Limited          | Yes               | Better for long-form fiction, detailed reports |
| QuillBot             | $20 ($8.33 annual)| Yes                      | Paraphrasing focus| Yes              | Stronger paraphrasing, weaker grammar    |
| Microsoft Editor     | Free (Microsoft 365)| Limited                | Yes (Copilot)    | Yes               | Free with Microsoft 365, Office combining |
| Hemingway Editor     | $20 (one-time)    | No                       | No               | No                | Focuses on readability, no subscription  |

Grammarly AI generally provides the most polished user experience and captures the widest range of issues. ProWritingAid offers more detailed writing reports, ideal for fiction authors analyzing manuscripts. QuillBot excels in paraphrasing and rewording sentences but lacks thorough grammar checking. Microsoft Editor, free with Microsoft 365, is attractive for businesses already using Office. Hemingway Editor emphasizes readability and sentence complexity without grammar checks. Most professional writers use multiple tools, using Grammarly for daily grammar checks and ProWritingAid for deeper analysis of longer pieces. The choice depends on writing needs and budget.

## Data Privacy and AI Training Concerns

When using Grammarly AI, your text is sent to their servers for analysis, raising concerns about data privacy and AI training use. According to Grammarly's privacy policy, they do not sell user data to third parties. For free users, Grammarly may use aggregated and de-identified data to refine algorithms. Grammarly Premium and Business users receive stronger privacy protections. Business customers can request data exclusion from product improvement. The company is SOC 2 Type 2 certified, utilizing encryption for data transit and at rest. For highly confidential content like legal documents, review the privacy policy carefully. Some organizations discourage cloud-based writing tools for sensitive documents. Grammarly offers settings to disable data collection, and Business administrators can control these for the entire team. Though Grammarly has never experienced a major data breach, inherent cloud service risks are present.

## Technical Integration and Platform Support

Grammarly AI Privacy and Security Framework:
![Technical Integration and Platform Support Diagram](/assets/ai-chat-bot/grammarly/user-content-encrypted.png)

Grammarly integrates with numerous platforms and applications used by developers and content creators daily. The browser extension works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, automatically activating on web-based text editors such as Gmail, Google Docs, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and WordPress. Native Windows and Mac apps provide desktop support. A Microsoft Office add-in is available for Word and Outlook on Windows and Mac. Mobile users can install the Grammarly Keyboard for iOS and Android, which replaces the default keyboard. Web developers can integrate Grammarly AI into their applications via the Grammarly Text Editor SDK, embedding Grammarly's checking capabilities directly into web apps. API access is available for Business and Enterprise customers. The tool requires an active internet connection, as all processing occurs on Grammarly's servers. The browser extension may slow certain websites or conflict with other extensions, while desktop apps perform better for intensive writing tasks.

## Accuracy and Limitations

Grammarly AI reliably detects common grammar mistakes but isn't flawless. The AI may suggest technically correct but awkward or unnatural changes. It struggles with creative writing, poetry, or intentional style choices breaking traditional grammar rules. Technical writing with industry jargon or specialized terminology may trigger false positives, marking correct terms as misspelled if not in its dictionary. Users can add words to a personal dictionary to resolve this. The tone detection feature provides guidance but can misinterpret sarcasm or subtle emotional content. The plagiarism checker identifies exact or near-exact matches only, missing sophisticated paraphrasing or idea plagiarism. For academic writing, dedicated tools like Turnitin offer more comprehensive checking. GrammarlyGO's generative AI produces decent draft content but requires significant editing, serving as a starting point rather than a replacement for human writing. Suggestions are based on general rules and do not comprehend specific audience or context without detailed prompts.

## Conclusion

Grammarly AI is the leading AI writing assistant, utilized by over 30 million daily users across diverse industries. It serves developers creating documentation, content marketers writing articles, small business owners drafting emails, and other professionals needing writing support. The free version covers basic grammar checks, while Grammarly Premium adds advanced AI features and plagiarism detection for $12 monthly on annual plans. Grammarly Business supports team collaboration and style guides starting at $15 per member monthly. Compared to alternatives like ProWritingAid, QuillBot, and Microsoft Editor, Grammarly AI offers the most complete feature set and refined user experience. Data privacy concerns arise since text is sent to Grammarly's servers for processing. However, the tool integrates smoothly with browsers, desktop apps, and mobile devices, providing accessibility wherever writing occurs. Despite some limitations, Grammarly AI captures most common errors, helping users enhance writing skills through explanations and suggestions.
