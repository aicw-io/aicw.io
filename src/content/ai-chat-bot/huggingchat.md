# What is HuggingChat

HuggingChat is a free AI chatbot that is both open-source and offered by [Hugging Face AI](https://www.huggingface.co/). This open-source chatbot platform provides users with various large language models at no cost, including models from [Meta's Llama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama_(language_model)) and [Mistral AI](https://www.mistral.ai/). Among these models are Meta's Llama chat, [Mistral AI](/ai-chat-bot/mistral/), and other innovations from the open-source community. Unlike proprietary alternatives, HuggingChat prioritizes transparency and a user-centric privacy approach, as emphasized in [IBM's overview of Hugging Face](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/hugging-face). It allows developers and researchers to test different AI models in one centralized location, similar to the functionalities offered by [Hugging Face's Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). Users can switch between models to compare their responses and capabilities, a feature highlighted in [TechRadar's analysis of Hugging Face](https://www.techradar.com/pro/what-is-hugging-face-everything-we-know-about-the-ml-platform). HuggingChat also integrates web search, enabling the chatbot to access current information beyond its training data. The platform is built entirely on open-source AI technology, allowing anyone to inspect its workings. Hugging Face designed HuggingChat as an alternative to closed-source chatbots such as ChatGPT or [Claude](/ai-chat-bot/claude/).

## Why HuggingChat Exists and Its Purpose


HuggingChat Architecture Overview:
![Why HuggingChat Exists and Its Purpose Diagram](/assets/ai-chat-bot/huggingchat/user-model-selection.png)

Hugging Face developed HuggingChat to illustrate that robust AI chatbots can be open-source and affordable. The company sought to showcase the capabilities of open-source AI models to a broader audience. While many are familiar with ChatGPT, they may not realize that open-source alternatives exist and perform similarly. HuggingChat serves as a demo platform for models hosted on the Hugging Face Hub. It assists researchers and developers in quickly testing various models without needing their own infrastructure. Small businesses and individual developers benefit by using it without concerns over API costs or usage limits. The privacy approach is crucial as HuggingChat doesn't require user accounts for basic usage, allowing anonymous interaction with AI models—something not typically possible with most commercial chatbots. The platform also educates users about diverse AI architectures and their strengths, promoting AI democratization and reducing barriers to entry.

## How the Hugging Face Platform Works

Hugging Face is a platform hosting thousands of AI models, datasets, and applications. Originally a chatbot startup, it evolved into the GitHub of machine learning. Developers can upload their trained models to the Hugging Face Hub for others to download and use. The platform supports various AI tasks, including text generation, image creation, and speech recognition. HuggingChat specifically uses models from this hub, refined for conversational AI. When you send a message through HuggingChat, it is processed by the model you selected. Hugging Face's servers manage all backend infrastructure, allowing users to interact without needing powerful computers. The web search feature connects to search engines to pull in real-time information when necessary, making AI accessible to non-technical users. The platform offers tools for fine-tuning models and creating custom AI assistants, enabling businesses to build their own AI applications efficiently.

## Key Features of HuggingChat

HuggingChat offers several distinct features that differentiate it from other chatbot platforms:

- Multi-model selection, enabling users to choose from open-source models like [Llama 3](/ai-chat-bot/llama/), Mistral, and Zephyr.
- Web search functionality to access current events and other information not in training data.
- Creation and saving of conversation threads for organizing different topics or projects.
- Code syntax highlighting to aid developers in programming queries.

## Privacy and Data Usage in HuggingChat


HuggingChat Interaction Flow:
![Privacy and Data Usage in HuggingChat Diagram](/assets/ai-chat-bot/huggingchat/user-message-selected.png)

HuggingChat has a unique privacy approach compared to commercial chatbots. When using HuggingChat without an account, conversations aren't permanently stored or linked to your identity. However, like most AI services, the platform may collect usage data for improvement and abuse prevention. Creating an account allows conversations to be saved for later access across devices. Hugging Face assures that conversations won't be used to train models without user permission, contrasting with some commercial services that default to using user exchanges for model improvement. Since the open-source models used in HuggingChat are already trained, your inputs don't automatically feed into training pipelines. Users should still avoid sharing sensitive personal information as conversations pass through Hugging Face servers. The web search feature sends queries to external search providers, each with their own privacy policies. For maximum privacy, developers can self-host HuggingChat using the open-source code, ensuring transparency about model usage and training data sources.

## Use Cases for Developers and Researchers

HuggingChat is beneficial for various user groups:

- **Developers**: Prototype AI features before constructing custom implementations and test different models to identify suitable architectures for specific use cases.
- **Researchers**: Compare model outputs to understand capabilities and limitations.
- **Content Creators**: Use for brainstorming and drafting initial content.
- **Students**: Experiment with different models without technical setup.
- **Small Businesses**: Explore customer service strategies and FAQ development.
- **Data Scientists**: Test prompt engineering techniques before production deployment.
- **Open-Source Enthusiasts**: Appreciate inspecting underlying code and models.
- **Educators**: Teach students about AI capabilities and limitations.
- **Marketing Professionals**: Evaluate content ideas and SEO strategies.

The platform's free access removes financial barriers for individuals and small teams exploring AI applications.

## Comparing HuggingChat to Alternative Chatbots

HuggingChat competes with a variety of chatbot platforms in the AI assistant space, each offering unique approaches:

|-------------|---------------|-------------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| HuggingChat | Free          | Yes         | Multiple models  | High          | Yes        |
| ChatGPT     | Free/Paid tiers | No          | GPT-3.5/GPT-4    | Medium        | Yes (paid) |
| Claude      | Free/Paid tiers | No          | Claude models    | Medium        | No         |
| [Bing Chat](/ai-chat-bot/microsoft-copilot/)   | Free          | No          | GPT-4            | Low           | Yes        |
| [Perplexity](/ai-chat-bot/perplexity/)  | Free/Paid tiers | No          | Multiple models  | Medium        | Yes        |

OpenAI's ChatGPT remains the most popular option with advanced reasoning capabilities in GPT-4, though it costs $20 per month for the best model, with all data routed through OpenAI's systems. Anthropic's Claude emphasizes safety with longer context windows and can incorporate web search through extended thinking and tool usage (beta). Bing Chat integrates GPT-4 with Microsoft's search engine but involves extensive data collection. Perplexity focuses on research and citations with robust web search but limits free usage. HuggingChat is notable for being entirely open-source and supporting multiple model options. Its privacy approach and zero cost make it appealing for users concerned about data collection, though proprietary models like GPT-4 and Claude often deliver higher-quality responses for complex tasks. The best choice depends on specific needs regarding cost, privacy, model quality, and features.

## Technical Details About Model Selection

HuggingChat supports several major open-source language models:
