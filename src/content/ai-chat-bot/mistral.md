## What is Mistral AI and Why It Matters

Mistral AI is a [pioneering French AI startup](https://www.forbes.com/companies/mistral-ai/) building open-weight large language models with a focus on AI efficiency and performance. Launched in 2023, it quickly became a prominent name in European AI. Open-weight models are AI systems with publicly released model weights, allowing developers and researchers to use them freely, fostering rapid adoption as developers integrate AI models into products, creating a strong ecosystem. This approach prioritizes efficiency; Mistral AI models compete with larger systems using fewer computational resources. This reduces running costs, essential for businesses reliant on AI models. Within months of launching, Mistral AI achieved a multi-billion euro valuation, bolstered by significant funding, including a €1.3 billion investment from ASML, [making it the largest shareholder in the French AI start-up](https://apnews.com/article/c62e3c9102f5ddd4969f3741235ea79d). Their primary offerings include Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B, designed for developers seeking powerful AI without extensive infrastructure costs, with [Mistral 7B outperforming LLaMA 2 13B on all benchmarks tested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral_AI).

## Understanding Open-Weight AI Models


Mistral AI's Position in the AI Landscape:
![Understanding Open-Weight AI Models Diagram](/assets/ai-chat-bot/mistral/model-approaches-closed.png)

Open-weight models, including those from Mistral AI, offer a middle ground between entirely open-source AI and closed systems. While open-weight models share trained parameters, they might not disclose training code or datasets. Despite this, they provide developers substantial freedom, such as running models on personal hardware, ensuring data privacy and control. This is particularly appealing for businesses focused on security. Training a model like the Mistral 7B is costly, but releasing weights allows others to bypass these expenses. This fosters rapid adoption as developers integrate AI models into products, creating a strong ecosystem. Mistral AI and others, like Meta with Llama models, drive this trend, whereas OpenAI maintains a closed approach with models like GPT-4.

## Mistral 7B: Efficiency Meets Performance

Released in September 2023, Mistral 7B marked Mistral AI's entry into the AI models space. With 7 billion parameters, it efficiently rivals models with 13 billion parameters. Utilizing grouped query attention, it enhances inference speed and memory efficiency, translating to reduced operational costs. Mistral 7B can process context windows of 8192 tokens, benefiting tasks like coding and reasoning. It supports multiple languages, excelling in English, and allows developers to fine-tune for specific needs, creating tailored models.

## Mixtral 8x7B: The Mixture of Experts Approach

Mixtral 8x7B, launched in December 2023, showcases Mistral AI's innovative mixture of experts architecture. This design involves eight smaller expert networks, activating selectively based on input. With 47 billion total parameters and only 13 billion active, it excels in performance and speed. It outperforms [Llama 2](/ai-chat-bot/llama/) 70B in benchmarks, managing larger context windows of 32000 tokens. A multilingual powerhouse, Mixtral is optimized for code generation and diverse language tasks through its specialized expert networks.

Mistral AI models, such as Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B, integrate into applications flexibly. Developers can run models locally, securing data privacy, or leverage cloud-hosted APIs. Startups utilize these models for enhancing AI features without necessitating in-house training. Applications range from chatbots in customer service to automated tutoring in education. Content marketers generate text drafts using these models, and legal firms use them for contract analysis. The models' effectiveness allows usage on less powerful hardware, making AI accessible for small businesses seeking AI efficiency.

## Funding and Growth Trajectory

In June 2023, Mistral AI raised approximately 385 million euros, a record for a European AI startup, valuing the company at 240 million euros. By December 2023, they raised an additional 385 million euros, elevating the valuation to around 2 billion euros, with investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Mistral AI's swift growth exemplifies European AI momentum, directly competing with American AI labs. Their ambition is to develop sovereign AI capabilities for Europe, providing an alternative to American or Asian providers while emphasizing data sovereignty and compliance.
