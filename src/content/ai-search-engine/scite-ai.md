## Introduction

Citation tracking is vital for academic research. [Scite.ai](https://www.scite.ai/) is revolutionizing our perception of citations through its Smart Citations technology. It provides insights beyond mere numbers by illustrating whether a citation supports, contrasts, or merely mentions a study, as detailed in [this study](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/2/3/882/102990/scite-A-smart-citation-index-that-displays-the). Key features include the Citation Statement Search and Zotero integration. Understanding and utilizing Scite.ai can transform research landscapes.

## What is Scite.ai?

Scite.ai is an advanced citation tracking tool. Rather than just counting how many times a paper is cited, it delves deeper. It reveals the context and meaning of citations. Users can identify if citations support or challenge findings. This makes it a powerful resource for deeper insights into research impacts.
