Yep is a privacy-focused search engine launched by Ahrefs in 2022. Known for its comprehensive SEO tools, Ahrefs decided to build its own search engine using an independent web crawler and index. What sets Yep apart from other search engines is its unique 90/10 revenue-sharing model. This means 90% of ad revenue goes directly to content creators, while Yep retains only 10%. The search engine prioritizes user privacy by not tracking searches or storing personal data. For businesses and content creators weary of big tech's dominance, Yep offers a strong alternative. It targets those who value privacy and support a fairer web ecosystem.

## What is Yep Search Engine

Yep is a web search engine developed by Ahrefs. Initially an SEO toolset provider, the company expanded into search in 2022. Unlike most search engines relying on third-party indexes like Google or Bing, Yep uses its independent web crawler, YepBot. Active since 2017, YepBot powers Yep's results by indexing billions of web pages. It displays standard web results, images, videos, and news. Behind the scenes, the revenue model and privacy approach make it unique. Ahrefs has invested heavily in technology and infrastructure to achieve this. 

## Why Yep Exists and Its Core Purpose

The search engine market is dominated by a few big players, led by Google with over 90% global search traffic. Ahrefs views this as unfair since content creators get little compensation for their work. Yep's 90/10 revenue split aims to rectify this, providing fair compensation to content creators whenever their web pages appear in search results with ads. Privacy is another pillar. Unlike most search engines, Yep doesn't track user behavior to build advertising profiles.

## How Users and Content Creators Use Yep

For users, Yep functions like any other search engine. Visit yep.com, type in a query, and browse results. Notably, it requires no account or login. Users choose Yep for its privacy features, searching without tracking by advertising networks. Others are drawn to its revenue-sharing model. Content creators can earn revenue if their site ranks in Yep results with ads. Verification through Ahrefs Webmaster Tools is necessary to receive payments, offering a new income stream even if currently modest.

## Comparison with Alternative Privacy Search Engines

Several search engines position themselves as privacy alternatives. Here's how Yep compares:

| Search Engine | Independent Index | Revenue Model | Privacy Features | Creator Payments |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Yep | Yes, own crawler | 90% to creators, 10% retained | No tracking, no logs | Yes, 90% of ad revenue |
| [DuckDuckGo](/ai-search-engine/duckduckgo-ai-chat/) | No, uses Bing + others | Traditional ads, 100% retained | No tracking, no logs | No |
| [Brave Search](/ai-search-engine/brave-search-ai/) | Yes, own index | Ad share with browser users | No tracking, no logs | No direct payment |
| [Startpage](/ai-search-engine/startpage/) | No, uses Google | Traditional ads, 100% retained | No tracking, proxy results | No |

## Yep's Market Position and Future Outlook

Yep holds a unique position in the search market as one of the few engines with an independent index. Building this required massive infrastructure investment, and its 90/10 revenue-sharing model is unprecedented. Challenges include user habits tied to major players like Google and the need for high search quality. While Yep's success depends on growing users, improving search quality, and building creator awareness, Ahrefs' resources provide long-term stability.

## Technical Implementation and Infrastructure

Ahrefs operates one of the largest web crawlers outside major engines. YepBot visits billions of pages daily, requiring enormous storage and complex ranking algorithms. Ads need relevance without compromising privacy, while the financial infrastructure ensures reliable revenue distribution to content creators. No tracking further ensures user privacy.

## Privacy Technical Details

Yep's privacy features include no use of tracking cookies and no storing of IP addresses or search history. Queries aren't tied to user identifiers, and analytics are aggregated without individual focus. The privacy policy commits to straightforward language, with no external tracking scripts on its pages.

## Content Creator Revenue Mechanics

The 90/10 split means ads must appear and be clicked for revenue. The revenue gets distributed among creators whose results feature with ads. Verification through Ahrefs Webmaster Tools is required for eligibility. While currently a modest income stream, this might grow with market share. 

## Challenges and Limitations

Yep's challenges include acquiring market share and perfecting search quality. Users are used to existing engines with intentional switching being rare. Monetization while maintaining privacy is difficult, potentially leading to lower ad revenue per search. Brand awareness is also limited, and regulatory complexities add additional hurdles.

## Use Cases and Best Practices

Yep serves privacy-conscious users wanting no tracking and content creators seeking additional revenue streams. SEO professionals can use it for diverse algorithmic insights. Developers might integrate Yep for privacy-focused projects. For effective use, clear and descriptive queries are advised. Browser integration may vary, with no dedicated mobile app available.

Yep is ambitiously reshaping search engine norms through privacy and revenue sharing. Its no-tracking approach and 90/10 revenue model offer a compelling alternative for privacy-conscious users and content creators. Despite challenges, Ahrefs' infrastructure and commitment provide a solid foundation for Yep's growth and innovation.
