## What is Consensus AI and Why It Exists

Consensus AI addresses a significant challenge in scientific research. Locating relevant research papers and discerning the consensus among scientists is laborious, a problem that [Consensus AI aims to solve](https://www.bentley.edu/library/in-the-know/what-is-consensus-ai). Conventional search engines like Google Scholar list numerous papers but fail to convey their collective meaning.

The main objectives of Consensus AI include:

* Quickly finding relevant research papers
* Displaying the level of scientific consensus on topics
* Simplifying complex research
* Saving time in scientific literature searches
