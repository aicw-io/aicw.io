## What is Naver Cue

Naver Cue, launched in 2023, is Naver's AI-driven response to tools like [ChatGPT](/ai-chat-bot/chatgpt/) and Google's AI search features. Integrating directly into Naver's search engine, it employs HyperCLOVA X as its language model. Unlike standalone chatbots, Naver Cue functions within the familiar search interface known to Korean users. Queries in Naver search yield AI-generated answers alongside traditional results, handling follow-up questions while maintaining context. Tailored for Korean language and culture, it surpasses global AI tools by connecting to Naver's comprehensive database of Korean news, blogs, forums, and more.

## Understanding HyperCLOVA X Language Model

HyperCLOVA X, Naver's proprietary large language model, builds on the 2021 release of HyperCLOVA. Despite the unverified parameter count of 204 billion, HyperCLOVA X enhances capabilities, primarily trained on Korean language data. This training includes Korean websites, literature, news articles, and user-generated content, enabling better comprehension of cultural context, idioms, and expressions compared to general-purpose models. While capable in multiple languages, it excels with Korean text, achieving superior results on Korean benchmarks. HyperCLOVA X powers not just Naver Cue but also supports other Naver AI services like content moderation, translation, and creative writing tools.

## Naver's Market Position in South Korea

Naver dominates South Korea's search market with over 50% market share, while Google Korea holds about 30%. This contrasts with most global markets where Google leads. Naver's success is rooted in its integration with Korean internet culture and services that extend beyond search, including email, news, shopping, and more. Korean users often choose Naver for online activities over Google. Strong ties with local content creators and businesses bolster Naver's position, generating significant advertising revenue. This unique advantage aids Naver in developing AI search tools, supported by extensive Korean user data and a deeper understanding of regulatory requirements.

## Comparing Naver Cue with Google Korea

Naver Cue directly competes with Google's AI search features in South Korea. While Google offers global AI-powered search, it struggles with the Korean market's language quality demands, where Naver Cue excels in nuances. Naver accesses exclusive Korean content that Google can't index effectively. While Google offers broader international content, Korean users trust Naver more for local information. Naver's ecosystem integration surpasses Google Search in Korea, offering a cohesive platform experience. Privacy concerns highlight Naver's local presence, easing user worries about data leaving Korea.

## Regional AI Search Competition and Market Dynamics

South Korea's unique market dynamics shape the AI search competition, influenced by high smartphone penetration that emphasizes mobile-first design and fast internet infrastructure supporting rich media and AI interaction. Naver capitalizes on Korean internet culture through its Cafe and blog platforms, while local competitors like Kakao and Samsung also invest in AI.
