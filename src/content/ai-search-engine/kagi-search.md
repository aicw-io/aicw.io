## What Is Kagi Search

Launched in 2022 by Vladimir Prelovac, Kagi Search is a Palo Alto-based paid search engine that emphasizes user privacy by offering ad-free search. The name "Kagi," meaning "key" in Japanese, reflects its mission to unlock a private search experience. Users pay a subscription fee to receive search results without advertisements, tracking cookies, or data collection. This privacy search engine targets users frustrated with ad-heavy results on platforms like Google and DuckDuckGo. Kagi has gained traction, now serving over 100,000 users who perform millions of monthly searches across desktop and mobile browsers, integrating seamlessly with Kagi's Orion browser.

## Why Paid Search Exists and Kagi's Purpose

Paid search engines like Kagi exist to counterbalance the ad-driven models of free alternatives. While Google dominates with daily searches exceeding 8.5 billion and annual ad revenue of $224.47 billion in 2022, Kagi flips the model by prioritizing users' needs. By paying a subscription fee, users receive clean, customized search results without sponsored links or tracking. This model aligns the search engine's success with user satisfaction, unlike ad-supported platforms. Paid search allows for user-driven result customization and domain blocking, akin to how Spotify and Netflix shifted from ad-supported services.
