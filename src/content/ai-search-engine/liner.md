## What is Liner AI

The core product is a *Chrome extension* that works seamlessly across websites and PDFs. As you browse the web, you can highlight text and save it directly to your Liner AI account. The extension also offers quick access to its advanced search feature.

Liner AI operates on a freemium model. Basic highlighting and limited searches are free, while premium plans unlock unlimited queries and advanced features. Although primarily targeted at students and academics, Liner AI serves anyone involved in online research.

The interface is divided between the browser extension and a web app. The extension handles highlighting during browsing, while the web app organizes your saved highlights and offers the full-featured search interface. Both options sync across devices when you're logged in.

## Purpose of Liner AI


AI Research Workflow:
![Purpose of Liner AI Diagram](/assets/ai-search-engine/liner/search-source-citations.png)

Academic research involves extensive reading from various sources, making it tough to keep track of crucial quotes and citations. Traditional note-taking apps fall short when browsing the web, requiring manual text copying, link saving, and separate organization.

Liner AI addresses this by allowing you to highlight directly on web pages. Each highlight saves automatically with source information, enabling you to add notes and organize them by topic, significantly reducing the effort needed to find and save information.

The *AI search engine* component solves another problem—general AI tools often provide answers without citing sources. For academic work, cited and verifiable information is crucial. Liner AI's search includes source links with every answer.

This AI tool also filters search results to prioritize academic and trusted sources. This feature helps researchers avoid low-quality content. The combination of highlighting, organization, and AI search creates a comprehensive research workflow within a single tool.

<a id="how-students-and-researchers-use-liner-ai"></a>

## How Students and Researchers Use Liner AI

Typically, users start with the *Chrome extension research* tool. After installation, highlight text on any webpage by clicking and dragging to select text, then choosing a highlight color. The text saves to your Liner AI library with the page URL and timestamp.

For AI search, open the Liner AI interface and type your question. The AI generates an answer with clickable source links below, making fact-checking easier than with standard AI chatbots.

Many students use Liner AI for literature reviews, searching for papers, highlighting key findings, and organizing highlights by research theme. This tool ensures everything stays in one place instead of being scattered across bookmarks and documents.

Researchers also use it for competitive analysis and market research. The highlighting functionality works on any website, not just academic papers, allowing you to save data from news articles, company websites, and industry reports. The search feature helps synthesize information from multiple sources quickly.

Some users combine Liner AI with reference managers like Zotero, using Liner for initial research and highlighting, then exporting citations to their reference manager, creating a two-stage workflow covering both discovery and formal citation management.

<a id="key-features-and-how-they-work"></a>

## Key Features and How They Work

The highlighting feature uses browser storage to save your selections. When you highlight text, Liner AI creates an overlay on the webpage. The highlight stays visible when you revisit the page if you're logged in. All highlights sync to the cloud and appear in your Liner AI dashboard.

You can organize highlights with tags and folders, aiding your work on multiple research projects. The search function allows you to find specific highlights by keyword, and the tool also supports PDF highlighting via the browser extension.

The search utilizes a large language model akin to [ChatGPT](/ai-chat-bot/chatgpt/), with the key difference being the source citation system. Every AI response includes clickable references back to the source web pages and documents.

Liner AI claims to prioritize *trusted sources AI* in responses, filtering results to favor academic papers, established news outlets, and verified websites. This feature is crucial for researchers needing reliable information.

The *Chrome extension research* tool adds a sidebar to your browser. Toggle it on or off while browsing, and the sidebar displays your recent highlights, offering quick access to the search. This keeps research tools readily accessible without switching tabs.

<a id="liner-ai-vs-other-ai-search-tools"></a>

## Liner AI vs Other AI Search Tools

Liner AI stands out by merging search with *research highlighting tools*. If you need both functions, Liner AI provides a better-integrated experience. When only search is needed, other tools might suffice, but Liner AI excels with its combination of search and *research annotation tool* capabilities.

ChatGPT with Bing integration offers sourced answers, but the citation quality varies, with sources not always being academic. Liner AI's filtering aims for higher-quality sources. ChatGPT caters better to general queries, whereas Liner AI targets research-driven use cases.

Google Scholar remains the standard for academic search, providing direct access to papers and citation counts. Liner AI's search adds a conversational layer, letting you ask questions in natural language rather than using keywords. For deep academic work, many researchers combine both tools.

Notion and Evernote compete on the organization side but lack integrated search. These tools necessitate manual copying of web content, whereas Liner AI's browser integration speeds up information saving during research.

<a id="privacy-and-data-usage-considerations"></a>

## Privacy and Data Usage Considerations

Liner AI collects your highlights and search queries to enhance its service, syncing this data across devices through your account. The company stores this information on their servers. Without an account, the extension can save highlights locally, albeit with limited features.

For search, your questions and the AI-generated responses are processed by Liner AI's systems. As with most AI tools, these interactions likely get logged. Note that free users' data may be used for service improvement, while paid plans might offer stronger privacy protections.

The *Chrome extension research* tool requests permission to access web page content—necessary for the highlighting feature. The extension can read and modify contents on pages you visit, a standard requirement for highlighting tools, which means the extension has broad access.

If working with sensitive research, consider what you save to Liner AI. While academic research is often public, early-stage work might be confidential. Local-only tools or self-hosted solutions offer more control over sensitive projects.

<a id="practical-use-cases-for-academic-research"></a>

## Practical Use Cases for Academic Research

Liner AI benefits literature reviews. Highlighting key findings when reading many papers keeps information organized. You can tag highlights by themes like methodology, results, or limitations, allowing you to search your highlights later instead of re-reading entire papers.

For thesis and dissertation research, maintaining source tracking over months or years is crucial. Liner AI's cloud sync ensures your research library is accessible anywhere. Highlight on your laptop, review notes on your phone—this flexibility aids progress on long-term projects.

Highlighting and Search Integration:
![Practical Use Cases for Academic Research Diagram](/assets/ai-search-engine/liner/webpage-browsing-highlight.png)


Group research projects can share Liner AI collections, with team members highlighting different sources, gathering highlights in one location—better than emailing documents. Verify current version supports team features, as functionality may be limited.

News monitoring and current events research excel with Liner AI, allowing break-new highlighting and connecting events via search across multiple sources. Journalists and policy researchers often use this workflow to keep track of developing stories.

Learning new topics becomes faster with search and *research annotation tool* features combined. When exploring new fields, Liner AI lets you ask questions and highlight the source material it provides, creating a learning path with integrated notes and references.

<a id="limitations-and-considerations"></a>

## Limitations and Considerations

The free tier limits searches daily, usually around 10-20 queries. For heavy research days, this fills up quickly, necessitating a paid plan for unlimited searches. Check Liner AI's current plans for pricing details.

Highlights only function in Chrome and Chromium-based browsers. Firefox and Safari users can't use the extension, limiting accessibility for those preferring other browsers. No official mobile app exists for highlighting, but search works on mobile browsers.

The search quality relies on available online sources. For highly specialized topics, responses might appear generic—the tool excels with subjects having substantial online documentation. Cutting-edge research might lack sufficient indexed sources for detailed answers.

Remember, Liner AI doesn't replace formal citation management. While it captures sources, it doesn't format citations in academic styles like APA or MLA. Tools like Zotero or Mendeley remain essential for bibliography generation, with Liner AI serving as a discovery and organizational layer.

Trusted source filtering isn't perfect—the AI sometimes surfaces low-quality sources. Always verify crucial information with primary sources. Use Liner AI to find leads, confirming details via authoritative references.

<a id="getting-started-with-liner-ai"></a>

## Getting Started with Liner AI

Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store by searching for Liner AI and adding it to your browser. Create a free account to sync highlights across devices. The extension icon appears in your browser toolbar.

Start by highlighting a few articles to test functionality. Select text, choose a color, and see your highlights in the Liner AI web app under your library. Experiment with tags to understand how organization works.

Test search capabilities with questions from your current projects, comparing answers and sources to findings through Google or Google Scholar. This helps gauge where Liner AI adds value to your workflow.

Set up folders for various research projects to keep highlights organized from the start. Keeping topics separate prevents confusion later. Consistent organization enhances the tool's long-term utility.

Explore the search function within your highlight library. As you save more content, searching becomes critical. Learn the search syntax early to quickly find information as your library expands.
