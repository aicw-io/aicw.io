        "text": "Experts from the American Heart Association (AHA) recommend several strategies for managing high blood pressure, also known as hypertension. These approaches are vital because hypertension is often a \"silent killer,\" causing significant health issues without obvious symptoms, such as damaging blood vessels and leading to heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease [heart.org](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure).\n\nHere are some of the key recommendations:\n\n1. **Maintain a Healthy Weight**: Managing your weight is crucial, as a healthy body mass index (BMI) of 18.5-24.9 kg/m² can significantly lower blood pressure. Weight loss can often directly benefit those who are overweight or obese [heart.org](https://www.heart.org/-/media/Files/Health-Topics/High-Blood-Pressure/Steps-To-Improve-High-BP.pdf?sc_lang=en).\n\n2. **Adopt a DASH-Style Eating Plan**: The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is recommended, featuring foods rich in fruits, vegetables, and reduced sodium intake. This dietary plan is effective in reducing systolic blood pressure [heart.org](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/the-facts-about-high-blood-pressure/high-bp-top-10).\n\n3. **Reduce Sodium Intake**: Lowering sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day, with a gradual move towards even lower intake, can help manage blood pressure levels [heart.org](https://www.heart.org/-/media/Files/Health-Topics/High-Blood-Pressure/Steps-To-Improve-High-BP.pdf?sc_lang=en).\n\n4. **Exercise Regularly**: Regular physical activity is another effective way to control hypertension. Engaging in consistent exercise can help rapidly lower blood pressure [heart.org](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure).\n\n5. **Monitor Blood Pressure Regularly**: Keeping track of blood pressure, especially if pregnant or at risk for preeclampsia, is vital for early detection and management [heart.org](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/the-facts-about-high-blood-pressure/high-bp-top-10).\n\nImplementing even small changes in these areas can make a significant difference in managing high blood pressure and reducing related health risks, such as cognitive decline, heart disease, and stroke.\n\n# CITATIONS\n\n1.

High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is often called a “silent killer” because it usually has no symptoms. High blood pressure quietly damages blood vessels and leads to serious health problems. There is no cure.
