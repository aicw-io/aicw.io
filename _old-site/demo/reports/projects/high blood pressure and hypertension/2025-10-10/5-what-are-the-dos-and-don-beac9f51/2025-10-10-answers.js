The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating plan is specifically designed to lower blood pressure[[4]](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/the-facts-about-high-blood-pressure/high-bp-top-10). Limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day (ideally under 1,500 mg)[[4]](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/the-facts-about-high-blood-pressure/high-bp-top-10)[[8]](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/high-blood-pressure/art-20046974).\n- **Stay Physically Active**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, such as brisk walking[[2]](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html)[[7]](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure).\n- **Maintain a Healthy Weight**: Losing even a modest amount of weight can help lower blood pressure[[2]](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html)[[4]](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/the-facts-about-high-blood-pressure/high-bp-top-10).\n- **Limit Alcohol**: Men should have no more than two drinks per day, and women no more than one[[4]](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/the-facts-about-high-blood-pressure/high-bp-top-10)[[8]](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/high-blood-pressure/art-20046974).\n- **Quit Smoking**: Smoking increases blood pressure and heart disease risk. If you don’t smoke, don’t start; if you do, seek help to quit[[2]](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html)[[12]](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/high-blood-pressure-hypertension).\n- **Manage Stress**: Practices like meditation, deep breathing, yoga, and mindfulness can help reduce stress and lower blood pressure[[2]](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html)[[4]](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/the-facts-about-high-blood-pressure/high-bp-top-10).\n- **Get Enough Quality Sleep**: Poor sleep can contribute to elevated blood pressure. Prioritize good sleep hygiene[[2]](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html)[[8]](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/high-blood-pressure/art-20046974).\n- **Take Prescribed Medications Properly**: Follow your healthcare provider’s instructions for any prescribed blood pressure medications[[1]](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Articles/2024/02/05/11/43/2023-ESH-Hypertension-Guideline-Update).\n- **Monitor Your Blood Pressure Regularly**: Regular check-ups and home monitoring can help track progress and detect any concerns early[[6]](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4314-hypertension-high-blood-pressure).\n- **Consume Potassium-Rich Foods**: Potassium can help counteract the effects of sodium on blood pressure. Include bananas, sweet potatoes, spinach, and other potassium-rich foods in your diet[[2]](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html)[[9]](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20373417).\n\n---\n\n## Lifestyle Don’ts\n\n- **Don’t Consume Excess Sodium**: Avoid processed foods, canned soups, deli meats, and salty snacks, which are high in sodium[[2]](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html)[[8]](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/high-blood-pressure/art-20046974).\n- **Don’t Drink Excess Alcohol**: Overconsumption raises blood pressure and can interfere with medications[[4]](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/the-facts-about-high-blood-pressure/high-bp-top-10)[[8]](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/high-blood-pressure/art-20046974).\n- **Don’t Smoke or Use Tobacco**: Smoking is a major risk factor for hypertension and cardiovascular disease[[2]](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html)[[12]](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/high-blood-pressure-hypertension).\n- **Don’t Neglect Physical Activity**: A sedentary lifestyle contributes to high blood pressure and poor cardiovascular health[[2]](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html)[[7]](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure).\n- **Don’t Ignore Stress**: Chronic stress can elevate blood pressure over time[[2]](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html).\n- **Don’t Skip Medications**: Failing to take prescribed antihypertensive drugs can lead to uncontrolled hypertension and complications.\n- **Don’t Consume Too Much Saturated and Trans Fat**: These fats can increase cholesterol and blood pressure[[2]](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html)[[9]](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20373417).\n- **Don’t Miss Regular Medical Check-Ups**: Regular visits with your healthcare provider are essential for monitoring and adjusting treatment as needed[[2]](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html).\n\n---\n\n## Medical Do’s\n\n- **Work Closely With Your Healthcare Provider**: Collaborate on a personalized treatment plan, which may include both lifestyle changes and medications[[1]](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Articles/2024/02/05/11/43/2023-ESH-Hypertension-Guideline-Update)[[6]](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4314-hypertension-high-blood-pressure).\n- **Consider Medication if Lifestyle Changes Aren’t Enough**: For many people, especially those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease, medication is necessary to achieve target blood pressure[[1]](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Articles/2024/02/05/11/43/2023-ESH-Hypertension-Guideline-Update)[[5]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2018/0315/p413.html).\n- **Know Your Blood Pressure Targets**: For most adults, aim for less than 140/90 mm Hg, but those with certain conditions (e.g., diabetes, chronic kidney disease) may need a lower target (e.g., <130/80 mm Hg)[[1]](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Articles/2024/02/05/11/43/2023-ESH-Hypertension-Guideline-Update)[[3]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8031779/)[[5]](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2018/0315/p413.html).\n- **Be Aware of Comorbidities**: Managing other conditions like diabetes, obesity, and high cholesterol is important for overall cardiovascular health[[3]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8031779/)[[4]](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/the-facts-about-high-blood-pressure/high-bp-top-10).\n\n---\n\n## Medical Don’ts\n\n- **Don’t Self-Medicate or Adjust Dosages Without Consulting Your Doctor**: Changing your medication regimen without professional guidance can be dangerous.\n- **Don’t Ignore Symptoms of Very High Blood Pressure**: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe headache, chest pain, vision problems, or difficulty breathing[[6]](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4314-hypertension-high-blood-pressure).\n- **Don’t Rely Solely on Medication Without Lifestyle Changes**: Lifestyle modifications are crucial, even if you are on medication[[6]](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4314-hypertension-high-blood-pressure).\n\n---\n\n## Official Resources for Hypertension Management\n\n-
