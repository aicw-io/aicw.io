It's important to regularly monitor blood pressure as it can lead to severe health problems such as heart attack and stroke, especially since many people might not experience symptoms until these conditions develop ([heart.org](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/the-facts-about-high-blood-pressure)).\n\nA significant portion of the population may have hypertension without even realizing it.

High blood pressure is also known as hypertension. It happens when the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your blood vessels is too high. High blood pressure can lead to other serious problems such as [heart attack](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks) and [stroke](https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke/types-of-stroke). Nearly half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure. Many don’t even know they have it. The only way to know you have high blood pressure is to have your blood pressure checked. A diagnosis of high blood pressure will need to be made by a health care professional.\n\n2. [High blood pressure (hypertension) - Symptoms & causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410)\n\nUntreated, high blood pressure increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and other serious health problems. It's important to have your blood pressure checked at least every two years starting at age 18. Some people need more-frequent checks. Healthy lifestyle habits —such as not smoking, exercising and eating well — can help prevent and treat high blood pressure. Some people need medicine to treat high blood pressure. Most people with high blood pressure have no symptoms, even if blood pressure readings reach dangerously high levels. You can have high blood pressure for years without any symptoms.\n\n3.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that globally, over 1.2 billion people aged 30 to 79 have hypertension. About 2 in 3 of those individuals live in low- or middle-income countries. Usually, high blood pressure doesn’t cause any signs or symptoms. That’s why healthcare providers call it a “silent killer.” You could have high blood pressure for years and not know it. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that 46% of adults with hypertension don’t know they have it.

But lifestyle changes play a vital role in treating high blood pressure. Controlling blood pressure with a healthy lifestyle might prevent, delay or lessen the need for medicine. Blood pressure often increases as weight increases. Being overweight also can cause disrupted breathing while you sleep, a condition called sleep apnea. Sleep apnea further raises blood pressure.
