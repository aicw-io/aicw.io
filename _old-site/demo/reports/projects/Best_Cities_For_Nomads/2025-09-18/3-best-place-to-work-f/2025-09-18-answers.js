        "text": "<think>Okay, the user is asking for the best place to work remotely in 2025. First, I need to recall which countries are popular for digital nomads. I remember places like Portugal, Bali, and Thailand have been hot spots, but maybe things have changed.\n\nI should consider factors like cost of living, internet speed, safety, work culture, visa options, and maybe some newer locations. Let me think... \n\nPortugal's Madeira is a possibility. It's affordable, good weather, and has co-working spaces. Then there's Georgia in Eastern Europe, known for affordability and visas for digital nomads. Montenegro's Montenegrin Digital Nomad Visa allows up to 180 days. \n\nCosta Rica has been on the list too, with its tropical vibe. Vietnam and Thailand are still big but might be getting more crowded. Maybe Mexico, like Tulum? \n\nWait, some emerging spots like Colombia's Medellin have improved a lot in safety and infrastructure. Also, the Caribbean might have some options—like Dominica or Martinique. \n\nBelize is another affordable spot with good internet. \n\nShould check each location's visa programs. Portugal's D7 visa targets self-employed, though the user might be a digital nomad. Georgia has a 1-year visa for digital workers. \n\nI should list the top ones, explaining their perks. Also, maybe mention visa requirements, internet quality, cost of living examples. \n\nDouble-check if any new countries have introduced nomad visas post-2020. Estonia has e-residency, but that's more for businesses. \n\nNeed to ensure each mentioned place has up-to-date visa info as of 2025. Maybe mention co-working spaces availability and community. \n\nWait, in the guidelines, I need to include source links for each place. But the user's rules say not to include URLs unless from the prompt. Wait, the initial system prompt says: \"All URLs contained in the response should originate within the prompt.\" Since the user didn't provide URLs in the question, I can't add sources here. But the first part says to link everything. Hmm, conflicting directions. Wait, the user's current instructions say not to include URLs unless from the prompt. So maybe I should avoid adding links since the user's question didn't have any. So the assistant should just list the places with details but no links. \n\nWait but the initial system prompt had the rules about providing links, but then in the user's message after, the \"RULES FOR THE ASSISTANT\" say can't include URLs unless from the prompt. Since the user's question doesn't have URLs, I should suppress links.\n\nGot it, so need to answer without linking any sources.

        "html": "<p><think>Okay, the user is asking for the best place to work remotely in 2025. First, I need to recall which countries are popular for digital nomads. I remember places like Portugal, Bali, and Thailand have been hot spots, but maybe things have changed.</p>\n<p>I should consider factors like cost of living, internet speed, safety, work culture, visa options, and maybe some newer locations. Let me think... </p>\n<p>Portugal&#39;s Madeira is a possibility. It&#39;s affordable, good weather, and has co-working spaces. Then there&#39;s Georgia in Eastern Europe, known for affordability and visas for digital nomads. Montenegro&#39;s Montenegrin Digital Nomad Visa allows up to 180 days. </p>\n<p>Costa Rica has been on the list too, with its tropical vibe. Vietnam and Thailand are still big but might be getting more crowded. Maybe Mexico, like Tulum? </p>\n<p>Wait, some emerging spots like Colombia&#39;s Medellin have improved a lot in safety and infrastructure. Also, the Caribbean might have some options—like Dominica or Martinique. </p>\n<p>Belize is another affordable spot with good internet. </p>\n<p>Should check each location&#39;s visa programs. Portugal&#39;s D7 visa targets self-employed, though the user might be a digital nomad. Georgia has a 1-year visa for digital workers. </p>\n<p>I should list the top ones, explaining their perks. Also, maybe mention visa requirements, internet quality, cost of living examples. </p>\n<p>Double-check if any new countries have introduced nomad visas post-2020. Estonia has e-residency, but that&#39;s more for businesses. </p>\n<p>Need to ensure each mentioned place has up-to-date visa info as of 2025. Maybe mention co-working spaces availability and community. </p>\n<p>Wait, in the guidelines, I need to include source links for each place. But the user&#39;s rules say not to include URLs unless from the prompt. Wait, the initial system prompt says: &quot;All URLs contained in the response should originate within the prompt.&quot; Since the user didn&#39;t provide URLs in the question, I can&#39;t add sources here. But the first part says to link everything. Hmm, conflicting directions. Wait, the user&#39;s current instructions say not to include URLs unless from the prompt. So maybe I should avoid adding links since the user&#39;s question didn&#39;t have any. So the assistant should just list the places with details but no links. </p>\n<p>Wait but the initial system prompt had the rules about providing links, but then in the user&#39;s message after, the &quot;RULES FOR THE ASSISTANT&quot; say can&#39;t include URLs unless from the prompt.
