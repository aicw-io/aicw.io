        "text": "Short answer\n- There isn’t a single, universally accepted “market size for open-source projects” because open source is a development and licensing model. Analysts typically size the commercial market around open source (support, consulting, subscriptions, managed/hosted services), often labeled “open-source services” or “enterprise open source.”\n- Public analyst summaries consistently indicate a market in the tens of billions of dollars globally and growing strongly, but exact figures vary by scope and are usually paywalled. As one representative example, see the open-source services market coverage by Grand View Research: [Grand View Research – Open Source Services Market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/open-source-services-market).\n\nWhat the growth trajectory looks like (evidence-based)\n- Developer/community growth: The latest GitHub Octoverse shows a rapidly expanding contributor base, with 100M+ developers using GitHub, indicating strong momentum in open-source creation and consumption: [GitHub Octoverse](https://octoverse.github.com/).\n- Enterprise adoption: Analyses like the Synopsys 2024 “Open Source Security and Risk Analysis” (OSSRA) report show open source is now in nearly all audited codebases (96%), underscoring mainstream enterprise reliance on OSS: [Synopsys OSSRA 2024](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/resources/analyst-reports/ossra.html).\n- Enterprise strategy lens: Red Hat’s 2024 State of Enterprise Open Source report documents widespread use of enterprise open source in production and strategic technology stacks, reinforcing continued commercial adoption: [Red Hat – State of Enterprise Open Source 2024](https://www.redhat.com/en/enterprise-open-source-report/2024).\n- Cloud-native adoption: The Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s surveys and ecosystem reports show sustained growth in cloud-native technologies (many of which are open source), with Kubernetes at the core: [CNCF – State of Cloud Native Development 2023](https://www.cncf.io/reports/state-of-cloud-native-development-2023/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).\n\nWhat’s driving the growth\n- Cloud-native and containerization: Organizations standardize on cloud-native stacks and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), most of which are open source, to gain portability, scalability, and ecosystem velocity: [CNCF – State of Cloud Native Development 2023](https://www.cncf.io/reports/state-of-cloud-native-development-2023/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).\n- AI/ML acceleration on open tooling: The modern AI/ML stack is heavily open source (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow), which pulls significant enterprise investment and talent into open ecosystems and fuels more commercial services around them: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).\n- Ubiquity in enterprise software supply chains: Open source now appears in almost every audited codebase (per Synopsys OSSRA), which drives demand for professional support, hardened distributions, managed services, governance, and security—i.e., the commercial “market” around OSS: [Synopsys OSSRA 2024](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/resources/analyst-reports/ossra.html).\n- Security and regulatory attention: High-profile supply-chain incidents and government actions (e.g., U.S. Executive Order 14028) have catalyzed investment in securing OSS and adopting best practices (e.g., via the OpenSSF), increasing paid offerings for security, compliance, and support: [Executive Order 14028](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/), [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/).\n- Enterprise “open core” and subscription models: Vendors package open-source components with enterprise-grade features, SLAs, and lifecycle management, which enterprises prefer for mission-critical workloads (see adoption sentiment in Red Hat’s enterprise report): [Red Hat – State of Enterprise Open Source 2024](https://www.redhat.com/en/enterprise-open-source-report/2024).\n\nHow big is the market right now?\n- By far the most commonly reported lens is “open-source services” (support, consulting, integration, training, subscriptions for hardened distributions, and managed/hosted OSS). Publicly accessible summaries consistently place this market in the tens of billions of dollars globally and forecast strong double-digit growth through the decade, though the exact numbers differ by firm and definition. Example coverage: [Grand View Research – Open Source Services Market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/open-source-services-market).\n- If you need a concrete revenue figure for planning, please specify your preferred scope (e.g., “open-source services only,” “enterprise open source subscriptions,” “managed cloud services for OSS,” or a combined view). I can then pull the latest figure from a specific analyst source (e.g., Grand View Research, MarketsandMarkets, Statista) and reconcile differences in scope.\n\nSources\n- Open-source services market overview: [Grand View Research – Open Source Services Market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/open-source-services-market)\n- Developer/community growth: [GitHub Octoverse](https://octoverse.github.com/)\n- Enterprise adoption in codebases: [Synopsys – 2024 Open Source Security and Risk Analysis (OSSRA)](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/resources/analyst-reports/ossra.html)\n- Enterprise adoption sentiment/trends: [Red Hat – State of Enterprise Open Source 2024](https://www.redhat.com/en/enterprise-open-source-report/2024)\n- Cloud-native landscape and adoption: [CNCF – State of Cloud Native Development 2023](https://www.cncf.io/reports/state-of-cloud-native-development-2023/)\n- Kubernetes (core cloud-native orchestrator): [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)\n- AI/ML open-source frameworks: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)\n- Security and policy driver: [U.S. Executive Order 14028](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/), [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/)",
