See practical “where to start” guidance for marketers in HubSpot’s overview of AI in marketing: HubSpot – AI Marketing (https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-marketing)\n\n- Establish lightweight guardrails and an internal AI policy before wide use. Define approved tools, data handling, human review, transparency, and risk processes. Use these widely referenced frameworks and principles:\n  - NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) (https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework)\n  - Google AI Principles (https://ai.google/principles/)\n  - Microsoft Responsible AI resources (https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai)\n  - OpenAI Usage Policies (what’s permitted, safety expectations) (https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies)\n\n- Protect data and privacy from day one.

Reliable practitioner resources:\n  - OpenAI Cookbook (prompt patterns, evaluation tips) (https://cookbook.openai.com)\n  - Google – Gemini Prompting Guide (https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting)\n\n- Run a 2–4 week pilot with clear success criteria and measurement.
