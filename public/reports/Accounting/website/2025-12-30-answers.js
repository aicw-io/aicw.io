        "text": "## Snapshot: what the accounting industry looks like now (2025)\nAccounting is splitting into two big “lanes”:\n\n1) **Regulated assurance + complex advisory** led by large firms and networks (audit/assurance, tax, deals, risk, forensics, ESG assurance). This lane is shaped heavily by regulators like the [PCAOB](https://pcaobus.org/), the [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/), the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/), and standard setters like the [FASB (US GAAP)](https://www.fasb.org/) and the [IFRS Foundation (IFRS)](https://www.ifrs.org/).\n\n2) **Cloud, automation, and “continuous” finance ops** (outsourced bookkeeping/CAS, close automation, AP/AR automation, payroll, embedded tax, real-time reporting), driven by software platforms like [Intuit QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/), [Xero](https://www.xero.com/), [Sage](https://www.sage.com/), [NetSuite](https://www.netsuite.com/), [SAP](https://www.sap.com/), and [Microsoft Dynamics 365](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/).\n\nAcross both lanes, the biggest forces are: **AI-assisted workflows, continued cloud migration, talent constraints, more data-driven audit/controls, and expanding reporting expectations (including sustainability/ESG reporting standards like the [ISSB](https://www.ifrs.org/groups/international-sustainability-standards-board/)).**\n\n---\n\n## Dominant market leaders & brands (services)\n### Global audit/tax/advisory leaders
