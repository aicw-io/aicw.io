        "text": "Below is a “map of the HR software world” (what to learn, who the major players are, and where to stay informed). I’m grouping it by the categories you’ll run into in real HR tech buying/building decisions.\n\n## 1) HR software categories (the core concepts to know)\nThese terms come up constantly in product discussions and RFPs:\n\n- **HRIS / HCM** (core HR system of record): [Human resource management system (HRMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resource_management_system), [Human capital management (HCM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital_management)  \n- **ATS** (recruiting system): [Applicant tracking system (ATS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system)  \n- **Payroll**: [Payroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll)  \n- **Time & attendance / workforce management**: [Time and attendance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_attendance), [Workforce management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce_management)  \n- **Performance management**: [Performance management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_management)  \n- **Employee engagement**: [Employee engagement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_engagement)  \n- **Learning (LMS)**: [Learning management system (LMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system)  \n- **Benefits administration**: [Employee benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_benefits) (common umbrella concept)  \n- **EOR / global hiring**: [Employer of record (EOR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employer_of_record)  \n- **PEO (co-employment model)**: [Professional employer organization (PEO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_employer_organization)  \n- **Background checks**: [Background check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check)  \n- **SSO / identity + provisioning (often critical for HR stacks)**: [Single sign-on (SSO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on), [System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_for_Cross-domain_Identity_Management)\n\nSecurity/compliance concepts you’ll see in vendor reviews:\n- **GDPR**: [EU GDPR portal](https://gdpr.eu/)  \n- **SOC 2**: [AICPA SOC](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-reporting)  \n- **ISO/IEC 27001**: [ISO/IEC 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html)\n\n---\n\n## 2) Most trusted enterprise HCM “suites” (core HR platforms)\nThese are widely used as “systems of record” in mid-market and enterprise:\n\n- [Workday](https://www.workday.com/) (Workday HCM suite)\n- [SAP SuccessFactors](https://www.sap.com/products/hcm.html) (SAP HCM suite)\n- [Oracle Fusion Cloud
